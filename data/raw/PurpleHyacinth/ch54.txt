Y lalren? can i have a moment? of course, will. what is it? is everything alright? it's not like you to be late.
Look, you don't need to tell me- okay what happened this morning _ lauren? (reak
Your eyebags are so heavy they're mopping the floor_ but you're never late, even if you haven't slept a wink. what's up? oh, hi lieutenant you okay there? you just slammed a door into me, ladelli' who the hell stands in a doorway?! 2221
A of peoplei well, sorry for not having x-ray eyes.
There was some trouble at the streetstalls, so i tried to intervene_ i think i hit my head on something_ maybe that's why i look so tired . it all resolved very quickly though. so really_ no need to worry you hit your head?! no wonder the new hot archivist didn't interest you! it's not you! it's the concussioni this is bad! no , kym_ im perfectly clear-headed
You better get checked out at the infirmary . give her some space_ kym: shove
You can skip patrol for today.
No will, id rather not - it's my responsibility to take care of you there's no way id let you on patrol knowing there's a risk you're injured. here take this. gul7y
You're officially on break.

There's really no way around you, is there? snhtc
Im worried about lalren. she hit her head? there's something more going on there: yeah, i think so too. she has to get it checked out , of course_
But even if it's nothing_ i think spending a day on bedrest might be good for her why did you think i insisted? sometimes, you just gotta find a way to force a break on her_ huh, i see not bad_ not bad at all_ i could actually respect you for this, lieutenant _
Well. thanks_
Oh! what's that?!
