Purple hyacinth
Episode 90
It is the only copy as far as i know .
Ai good_
I found the woman you were looking for.
Her name is elvira llyod, 45 years old, living in the 11th district . pretty unremarkable background and never suspected to be part of the phantom scythe.
She's had several jobs as manager and is currently the director of the glass factory - on sherbrooke street , in the 11th as well
Elvira lloyd. huh; yes. she's involved in the import and dissimulation of nitro in the 7th's operation: but i know nothing more for now . i see. thank you: how are yolr phantom scythe files coming along? clp
When are you thinking of releasing them?
By the end of this month: if i live until then; are you. planning on outing the purple hyacinth too? no. not for now at least .
He's a precious help to our common goal.
What made you choose this goal, exactly? what changed?
In the phantom scythe_ the apostles' speciality is to find any of your weaknesses and use them against you. stl
Sake needed me to steal money and when he dragged me into his shady business.
He didn't forget to mention i had a dalghter to his apostle. clara _ you've seen her only once or twice, you probably can't remember. so they used her to blackmail you into doing their dirty work.
I'm far from being the only one they used this tactic on.
Before i even knew what the phantom scythe was- they already knew everything on me.
And you've worked all these years for the phantom scythe becalse of that? does she know you are alive?
No_ it was better if she believed i was dead like everyone else. clara , you know, she.
I used to take her skipping stones everyday.
She wanted to learn so badly. hahaha, kids. 9
I tholght it was silly back then, but now i treasure those memories a lot. clara was the only thing i had left . i watched her grow from afar_ marry into the noble grayson family _ becoming a lady 4
I later realized she had started working as a double agent for the apd too. i wish i could've been there to prevent her. grayson. where have i heard about it before. ?
You asked me what changed.
Well. two months ago.
On the night of november 13th_ 00sh~

Hmmf -
She was assassinated _ by none other than the purple hx acinth.
Hello? officer sinclair here_
An emergency?
What happened?
Miss! please try to stay calm; you're safe now.
You did the right thing , calling us right away_ can you tell us what happened? where is mrs. grayson?
I wanted to make sure everything was alright _ but then i saw step stzp
B-blood. s-so much blood - ~and a limp hand sticking out of the doorframe and i--
Yes, i remember_ good morning to all.
As many of you already know)_ two of our double agents were murdered last night   in the m1th precinct . two people were murdered that night i chased after the purple hyacinth. lady grayson was his daughter?! but then
Like i've told you, from that point on, i had nothing more to lose.
I'm sorry for your dalghter.
You are a strange man, sandman. you've killed my parents, and yet you come back 10 years later to help me and the killer of your dalghter  ironic , isn't it?
There is one thing you have to understand about the phantom scythe. when you are given an order , even if you don't execute it , someone else will.
It's ^ a fate the victims cannot escape_ a fate that will be yours too or that of the people you care about - if you refuse to obey_ and some people are more than happy to carry those orders to completion- believe me. some others _
You know.
His flowers made me understand that him and i are two sides of the same coin .
What do you mean?
Do you really think. fw _
The purple hyacinth is leaving flowers next to his victims as a threat to the royals?
No_
Well then. @hrow
Wait _ i'm not done yet. ksy
There is something else i've meant to ask you.
What was robin delaney doing in the car with you? ene that day  delaney's role was to_ retrieve someone for the apostle: i never knew why_ don't know what happened after either, just that delaney was killed_ 1
The apostle wanted the kid to be brought to him: the other. was collateral damage.
Collateral damage?! what do you-
Watch out! fis
