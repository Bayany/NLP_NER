You make me come all the way here instead of just sending your messenger- ~and you expect me to be on time? @aok cnk
That's awfully rude aren't you happy to see me? i'm seeing you too often since i started doing shows again. why are you even wearing that mask_ "seventh"? well this is serious official business after all apostles are required to wear one when they speak to their subordinates_
Li don't be ridicllous.
Haha- you're spoiling my fun. spin
Here are the reports from my mst recent contracts give them to the fourth, i'm not going through the hassle of reaching out to his damned messenger_ must say , congratulations! you've become quite infamous grlesome and efficient_ just as always i'm sure the fourth will be pleased with your work_ of course_ do ever disappoint? oh_ by the way _ we received the delivery yesterday_ our last two players are still sticking to the plan like obedient pawns_ think neither flemmings nor elvira will surprise 4s. tss 1 1 0 spin
Splendid! only a few more weeks before we can reclaim what's ours. isn't that exciting?
Putting this city through fire and blood?
Extremely_ i am bored out of my mind these days.
Poor little thing . all those insipid , meaningless murders. you haven't had much fun since sake. almost a shame you killed him so quick.
He was useless, and getting on my nerves. he only got what he was begging for and what about that curious police officer? 741c
I had a few questions for him about the officer who almost exposed him: she's useful to my infiltration mission.
I wanted to make sure sake wouldn't stab her to death in a backalley _ before im ready to get rid of

Our good old messenger let me know she visited you yesterday .
You aren't still mad at me over her, i hope? you know it was for yolr own good.
Emotions will only get you killed, bella. i've talght you better than that. they would only make you lose your_ u clvte
Spark _ and you know i have no use for dead matches.
Blt a single spark can burn you down . so be careful how you play with it _ haha! there you are, bella! i knew you weren't hiding too deep . do you need me for something else? pelgar
I received new mission for you this morning , bella. the leader wants you to keep an eye on the purple hyacinth.
Keep him alive though .
