18,will appear before the judge tomorrow and face all the charges he 's escaped the past years . In
18,"normal circumstances , further investigation would be required before lune 's work could be considered actual evidence but the i.u.reproduced and verified everything The final decision of the judge will probably have to wait until we identify lune : But"
18,mctrevor will certainly be incarcerated in the meantime . Whoever
18,"or whatever lune is , he will not be able to hide in the shadows for long . i"
18,will not tolerate being toyed with by a coward hiding behind a mask . If
18,"he is half as smart as he pretends to be , he should know that my patience is very thin and that whatever crimes he commited to assemble this file will not be overlooked . I"

63,way we 've responded to the phantom scythe over the past decade is just as egregious as how we 've failed to deal with the injustices constantly perpetrated in our city the current structure is far from perfect . it
63,'s often not even fair or right lune 's actions are also in this grey zone Neither completely right nor completely wrong . i
63,ca n't help but feel like we 're shooting ourselves in the foot by trying to break lune 's anonymity . Yet
63,we must becalse we all answer to the same law : and it is our duty to protect that law as we are now we ca n't fix the system or its past wrongs but at least we can make sure the right people are accused and that the innocent ones are protected I know it 's not an easy task . not

84,", earlier today you said you found a witness ?"
84,after
84,hearing about your little misadventures with our good friend sake . I
84,could n't resist the temptation to look into chow 's case file . the
84,way sake wormed out of suspicion was acthally quite clever . Right
84,after the poker game . he
84,visited his neighbor to have a beer with him purposefully to be seen at home that night . then
84,he snuck out of his apartment to murder chow . and
84,went straight to maria 's after to hide the murder weapon . Correct
84,. i
84,"read the transcripts too you really did lose it , officer . And"
84,your hair trigger temper has n't changed mlch since : Yeah . But
84,with an ability like yours . it
84,would have driven anyone to the edge . Still
84,not an excuse to slam people into walls though . Yeah
84,. it
84,is not . I
84,should know . Anyway
84,", i 've investigated sake the last few days for information on his past jobs . Turns"
84,"out he has quite the record , and was n't always the most stealthy hitman out there . whenever"
84,"there was a witness , he 'd kill them too , or at least threaten to do so . sounds"
84,like him : In the file i 've found the names of all the people brought in for interrogation . the
84,woman living right beside the crime scene you never met her because of your little outburst she swore up and down she had n't seen anything so i paid her a little visit you know ; just to check if her version of tale would still be the same now that sake 's death is all over the papers And ?
84,what
84,did she say ?
84,she
84,used t live right next t the alley where sake murdered chow . She
84,"witnessed everything from her window , but sake noticed . and"
84,before she could tell anything to the cops over the phone : He was pointing a knife to her throat . She
84,confessed to you ?
84,!
84,She
84,'s ready to speak in court What
84,And obviously i ve asked her to pretend she never saw me . she
84,just spontaneously decided to come clean !
84,Kieran
84,", that 's . incredible"
84,. If
84,she 's willing to change her statement the case could be reopened . Why
84,?
84,why
84,are you doing this ?
84,No
84,particular reason . I
84,"can help you , but for this to work you 'll have to be honest about what happened between you and sake . sqwnts"
84,I will . Here
84,"'s your coffee . "" bm"
84,""" Monster ( pip S so uh . when"
84,we went to the circus you mentioned having had a little chat with sake a few days before . j
84,What
84,exactly did he tell you ?
84,We
84,did n't talk about chow 's case then . but
84,the night we infiltrated the restalrant i overheard him telling belladonna about it . I
84,"drugged the ex wife , got her prints on the knife . And"
84,hid it in her bedroom after i was done . hmm
84,", i see . That"
84,'s gon na be hard to prove now that he 's dead . even
84,"if the witness is willing to change her statement , we 'll also need evidence to back it up when i saved sake last year i found a bottle of a black market sedative on him . 0"
84,2
84,strong enough to put a horse to sleep Yeah
84,", i think i know that one . Would"
84,'ve knocked maria out before she even noticed the change in her stew 's seasoning I was n't able to submit it as evidence last year but if sake really has a record maybe we can find other cases where he used the same m.o . and try to establish a correlation . it
84,"still would n't be enough , but it 'd be a start . It"
84,'s your time to shine . Detective
85,Yes

85,"like the allendale train station tragedy nobody could 've known they would strike there i , for one was shocked crmka he 's part of the phantom scythei A"

85,Purple hyacinth Episode It
85,'s your time to shine Detective . A
85,few days later . Her
85,version of the story fits what we already have . clalk
85,Sake would 've had the time to break into her apartment and leave before we reached the crime scene : it would n't be the first time a witness has wanted to change their deposition once the killer is dead . except
85,", we already locked a killer behind bars . We"
85,do n't have anything else to prove sake 's guilt here . it
85,'s one woman 's word against the evidence . Maria
85,could have been framed . that
85,would n't be a first either . It
85,"'s pretty simple , actually . he"
85,could 've drugged her with the black market sedative lauren found on him last year . and
85,how do you intend to present this to the court ?
85,They
85,wo n't revisit their sentence based on such flimsy speculation . If
85,"you take a look at this , you might change your mind . there"
85,"are other cases that could be linked to this one what the hell is this , sinclair ?"
85,last
85,time i checked you were still on suspension . You
85,'re not a detective : you 're actually a suspect in this man 's murder . what
85,tells me you did n't bribe the poor woman to help your case ?
85,Captain
85,hermann . my
85,I am not trying to overstep the boundaries of my suspension . You
85,may dislike me because i let personal feelings affect my duty a year ago and you 're right i
85,have messed up but this is nt abolt me . and
85,this is nt about you . An
85,innocent woman has been rotting in the tower for over year And last time i checked It was our duty to uphold justice in this city . You
85,ca n't redefine justice and bend the rules however you want . (
85,"itmua [ w captain hermann , if i may interject . lalren"
85,"is clever and perceptive , and has never given you a reason to doubt her morals . Her"
85,hypothesis has never been completely improbable . And
85,the witness 's confession just now changes everything . i
85,ve looked at the file she compiled on sake and she 's got enough evidence to open an investigation : we can not just discard her work . and
85,i strongly believe she might be right Whether what this woman says is true or not . it
85,is our duty to re examine the case . and
85,admit our mistakes if there were any . Uf
85,Fine . you
85,have my althorization to proceed with the appeal Detective march and detective cooper will be in charge of the case . sinclair
85,will be able to participate as a consultant due to her knowledge of the case . But

85,thought he 'd never agree . The
85,"battle is far from won , but this is such a relief Thank you for stepping in for me . You"
