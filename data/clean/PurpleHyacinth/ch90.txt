I saw rafael What?! where? i saw him at the circus a few days ago. The pianist If he's part of the pantheon, it means that he's been there for a while. gnh? Hard to believe, isn't it? ten years later. Not even once did he reach out. he's probably been back in ardhalis city for years, for all i know. not a single call, not a single letter. Rafael had a tattoo on one of his wrists. Just like the messenger Glp How did you react? i lost it. when i saw him. i couldn't believe it. you know . All these years, since the atst.

All these years i didn't even know if he was still alive. 7/p But that didn't stop me from thinking about all the things i wished i could tell him. tap h n fhlf He used to be my hero when i was a kid. And from one day to the next i had to start acting like that he never existed. Kh I've never seen my father angrier, and my mother so. broken hearted Hey pat Anyone in your position would have collapsed so long ago. If i ever bump into him, i'l beat him up. please don't do that haha. Will, look at me. I'm proud of you, you know . You were a little rascal when we were playing together hahaha! but even back then, your father didn't want you to become too close with people who. weren't as high perched in social hierarchy as him. And the son of a gardener, even less. he made sure to rarefy the visits. but look at yourself now . you've grown into a strong resilient brilliant man. You've stood up for your mother, admirably . and no matter what happened your kind heart never changed. And that's incredible , you know . And this can't keep going on indefinitely , will. You have to stop living for somebody else, you hear me? You're right . we should head back inside before they think we actually ran away . It's not too late for that you know . Hahaha! threei Two! Onei Happy new yeari Maybe a glass of water will miracllously make me fall asleep . Sigk Tf I thought everyone left. What are they doing up at this hour? They are all so stubborn and their ego so inflated a that they simply refuse to accept reality! no matter what i do; no matter how many chances they are given. They barely concede to anything and side with the queen almost inevitably . philip may wear the crown, but the reins are in lizbeth's hands. am i right hand for anything at all? you've spent all of your time as right hand advocating for the betterment of this country. Trying to open their eyes. even you can't fight alone against an entire cabinet of ministers. blt now it's coming, just like ten years ago the storm is stirring. Only , this time, the phantom scythe has had an entire decade to grow in power. it's no longer just a handful people ready to blow up a train station and tie up a dead man to be heard. It's ready for so much worse. Ever since the aevasthers ordered the assassination of those poor people. hsy They signed their own demise.
