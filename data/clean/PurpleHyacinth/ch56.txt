What did you want talk about , kym? clid We need to talk about lune. Okay? i've been thinking about the mission hermann gave 4s this morning . I don't really see how spying on our coworkers will help find lune: It's been over a month since they dropped their first file. if there were any incriminating office gossip that one of them was part of lune we would already know by now. Loriub all we can do is observe and be attentive to details. yeah, but considering how thorolgh they've been with everything else, i doubt we'll have much to eavesdrop on. especially at the precinct where they must be extra careful. We're not dealing with amateurs. So what do you propose? I propose: The golden clover the golden clover is the only known public place where lune has been spotted. I want to verify something there. kym: we aren't detectives. Youre right we arent Zdk We're soleil. tmti Okay, i'm out hold up come with me or else. g Boop *** i will **** ****** and ******** ** **** glnk blak Welcome to soleil, partner. Purple hyacinth Episode Do you even know where you're going? I'd rather be on a romantic picnic with hermann than get lost with you again . of course i do we patrol this city everyday . The golden clover is in our precinct That's never stopped you before. Oh no; where are we? kym; why did you bring me here? I don't even know where we are. oh no! where's lieutenant? 3 he'll get lost all by himself! lies and slander you're just envious of my natural sense of direction. The golden clover is on the right . Ladell the golden clover is right in front of us also you're pointing left. Ah see? i knew i could find it! siap Should have let her get lost in the city alone ah , also U a i can plan a romantic picnic between you and hermann anytime you want . Please dont??? Wow Good evening welcome to the golden clover. may i help you? hi, i am sergeant ladell And i'm lieutenant hawkes.

(olsh Please follow me what're you up to, kym? oh i just want to have a little chat im sure the manager would love to have us! Manager 's office ms . karen smith Good evening i'm karen smith, the owner of this establishment to what do i owe this particular pleasure? lieutenant hawkes, 11th precinct sergeant ladell, 11th precinct please forgive 4s our impromptu visit we're here on behalf of the investigation unit we just want to quickly follow up on mr anslow's arrest three weeks ago. ah, yes the lune incident your detectives already combed the clover for evidence Yes, you told detective march that many customers left their personal affects behind that night , right? You did raid the place everyone left in a panic we found wallets, keys, glasses. most of it was retrieved by the owners in the following weeks but business has been terrible since, i swear you people just most? some items still haven't been reclaimed? Hmm, yes. i can show ou. Here, all that's left from that night. A coat? mlis: Who doesn't come back for their coat in cold weather? You'd be surprised. must've belonged to some couple who were too rich to care. 0ocoou don't bother searching the pockets, they're all empty . Alright, well nothing here seems to fit the criminal profile. Thank you for your cooperaton! shovg Don't come back. Kym, are you okay? i know this wasn't exactly Today i realized i had overlooked crucial details my own certitude had led me to believe things which were wrong why are you talking to yourself? Shut up! im channeling laureni you're what now? Hnng lauren . goddess of deduction please lend me some of your detective powers! why is she imitating a racoon again? i'm sure we're onto something! gr1b I justt have to put the pieces together It's peculiar that they never came back for their fancy coats but it's not a crime. What if there's a woman on lunes team? Isn't that. huge jump? Remember what that weird lady said. or this "lune" they talk about?! that's two people, right? it sounded like two peoplei Whale one of them seemed much lighter than the other, maybe it was even a woman! were the only ones who know about this leadi The iu is looking for a group of two or more men. you also brought the pipe with you? items like these don't fit so the coats were disregarded three weeks ago. but it's mlch more suspicious now that most people have picked up their things. Why would this coat be linked to lune? why leave it behind? Think about it anslow was in the bar for while before he woke up in the storage room: Lune needed to trick him or at least knock him out . to drag him there without anyone noticing . They were on deadline: they couldn't just wait for him to go to the bathroom alone. the police might've shown up before they finished so you think lune was undercover in the bar? and we just found this abandoned coat . whl We know lune is two people: based on what miss arthingham said, one is still likely a man. the iu would have taken anything he left behind. leaving only the lady's coat behind That's actually a solid theory But we don't have enough evidence to support it . yeah . we don't . we should look into it , though. Then why did you leave the coat behind? Let's just say that, now . i really want to find lune before hermann does. Cliu Pvsh creak
