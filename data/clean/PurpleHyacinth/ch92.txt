I see our serial killer is on a spree. tonight's mlrders don't seem related to harvey's or sake's. the three nobles also had no apparent ties to each other. sup I believe we're dealing with a hitman from the phantom scythe. we know some of their assassins accept contracts for cash on the side. And what about sinclair? who was with her last night? Officer sinclair was home the entire night . dozens of glests, chief sinclair and lord rhysmel can confirm it . I see. that's good for her, i suppose: So hapy tmul yolre not murderer laureni!! hermann will have no choice but to cut you some slack now wl s stills three mlrders in one night? that's insane: know right! and so soon after the circus there's no clear connection so it must be some sort of contract killer ah: let's stop talking about this murder it's giving me headache just want to forget about this morning Earlier that day.

Ahhhh, so that's why will looks so disheveled wcp Hey guys. Evening , detective march. what did hermann say? Investigation unit will cooperate with other precincts to look for the culprit . With three murders in a row; the killer may have left some clles. the police might stand a chance to find something this time. otherwise good news for you, sinclair! yolr name will most probably be cleared becalse of last night's events. gruk Hermann will not be able to keep you on suspension without more evidence. i just wish that three brutal murders weren't necessary to prove my innocence in his eyes. Did you hear, kieran? Oh, yes, i've heard about the mlrders. it would send chills down anyone's spine: but i'm glad officer sinclair is no longer suspected I also have good newsconcerning chow's case. The file we presented to the court has been accepted. the appeal will start this week. Id The appeal was solved quickly. With our leads and the witness's testimony The investigation unit was able to gather enough evidence to prove maria's innocence. Seeing her freed felt like i did the right thing for the first time in a long while. But that relief was only for a short duration. Miss! miss! me? This is for you. tsk Wait! T 7p Vf id
