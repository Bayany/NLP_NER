She was like the sun. everyone was inevitably drawn to her joie de vivre: She was also fearless. Actually , that's why sometimes other people were scared of her. I still remember that time she chased down a man twice her size with our garden gnome becalse he was harassing olr neighbors. It's been a little over ten years since she died. I keep meaning to tell you i'm sorry for leaving so abruptly the other night . this. this was her watch. i kept it after she passed.
